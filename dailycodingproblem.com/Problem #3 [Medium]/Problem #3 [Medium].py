# This problem was asked by Google.

# Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.

# For example, given the following Node class

# class Node:
#     def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
# The following test should pass:

# node = Node('root', Node('left', Node('left.left')), Node('right'))
# assert deserialize(serialize(node)).left.left.val == 'left.left'


# ??? i have no idea what to do for this sorry im still learning
# i know i can look it up but im taking a brake from school coding for this coding and will come back to it later (i hope)
